# Zip Bot

This project was created, during studies about networks at college, to be a bot that would go through folders while zipping new files and excluding old zips. It was initially thought to do this job with server logs.

# To install the service:

- Run your command line with administrator rights.
- Navigate to the dist folder containing the `.exe` file
- Run "C:\Windows\Microsoft.NET\Framework64\VERSION\InstallUtil.exe." + File_Name.exe
- Start the service in the Windows Service Manager running "services.msc"
